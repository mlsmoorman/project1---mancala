The word Mancala is derived from an Arabic root meaning "to move".

History:  One of the oldest known games to be played today, Mancala has been found in archeological evidence dating back as early as 700AD in East Africa, however, some of the oldest boards date back to approximately 5,780BC in Jordan.

SetUp:  To start the game board shows an empty Mancala and score of zero assigned to each player along with 6 pockets on each side of the board containing 4 stones -- side A and side B.

Object:  The object of the game is to capture the most marbles by the end of the game.

Game Play:  
  1. The game begins with one player (selected by random draw) picking a pocket from their side of the game board.
  2. The chosen pocket will then disburse around the board dropping one stone in each pocket, including the player's Mancala but skipping the opponents Mancala
  3. If the count ends in the player's Mancala, that player gets to take another turn.
  4. All captured pieces go to the player's Mancala

Winning the Game:
  1. The game ends when all 6 pockets on one side of the Mancala board are empty.
  2. The player that still has pieces on their side of the board captures those pieces and they are deposited to that player's Mancala
  3. The player with the most pieces in their Mancala at the end of the game WINS!!!



  //future version - CAPTURE// If the last piece dropped is in an empty pocket on the player's side of the board, that piece along with any pieces in the pocket directly opposite are moved to the player's Mancala
